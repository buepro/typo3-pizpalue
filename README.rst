==========================
TYPO3 extension `pizpalue`
==========================

Description
===========

This extension started as a distribution and is now a template serving as a base
foundation for new websites. The former distribution part became to be a new
distribution called `pizpalue_distribution` and can be downloaded from
`the TYPO3 extension repository <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/pizpalue_distribution>`__.

The extension builds upon the extension `bootstrap_package from Benjamin Kott <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/bootstrap_package>`__
and serves as a base template for the creation of websites or
`distributions <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ExtensionArchitecture/CreateNewDistribution/Index.html>`__
using the `bootstrap framework <https://getbootstrap.com/>`__. As an example the
distribution `pizpalue_distribution <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/pizpalue_distribution>`__
uses this extension. A demo site can be visited `here <http://pizpalue.buechler.pro/das-plus/>`__.

The extension extends and configures TYPO3 and selected extensions to provide
better structured and attracting content while maintaining or improving speed
and seo performance.
