.. _config-easyconf:

Easyconf
========

The extension `easyconf <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/easyconf>`__
provides a module to easily configure main aspects from the website. It allows
to configure typoscript as well as site configurations. Additionally css
snippets can be defined. Thanks to these features the constant editor isn't
needed much any more.

To ease configuration parameters were grouped. The following main categories
are available:

============================ =========================================================
Category                     Description
============================ =========================================================
PIZPALUE: ADMINISTRATION     Everything related to the site administration
PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER BASE      Main customer related parameters
PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER STYLE     More detailed customer style related parameters
PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER SOCIAL    More detailed customer social network related parameters

============================ =========================================================

   Most extensions provide their own configurations. For more detailed
   configurations consult the related manual.


.. _config-scaffold:

Scaffold
========

Footer columns
--------------

The behaviour from the footer columns can be adjusted through the column classes
available under the category `PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER EXTENDED` in the constant editor.


.. _config-scrollanimation:

Scroll animation
================

This feature is using one of the libraries
`Twikito/scroll-effect <https://github.com/Twikito/onscroll-effect>`__ or
`Josh.js <https://github.com/mamunhpath/josh.js>`__. They allows to animate
content elements while the page is being scrolled.

Four preconfigured animations are available in the animation dropdown menu from
the appearance tab in the content element properties dialog. Those animations
might be configured as well in the constant editor (category "PIZPALUE:
CUSTOMER EXTENDED - Animation").

.. hint::

   Embedding from scroll animation js-libraries is triggered by the presence
   from the strings `data-scroll` or `data-josh` in a content element attribute
   field.


.. _config_cookieconsent:

Cookie consent
==============

To show a cookie dialog the "Enable Cookie Consent"-parameter has to be set
(constant editor category "PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER BASE - Cookie consent"). As well
a link to a privacy policy page can be set for the cookie dialog.

Further configurations regarding the cookie dialog can be found in the constant
editor by selecting the category "PIZPALUE: CUSTOMER EXTENDED" under the section
"Cookie consent".

.. note::

   For Google Analytics a control block can be embedded by using the string
   ###GoogleAnalyticsStatus### in a content element.


.. _config-appIcons:

App icons
=========

In case just a simple favicon is required it can be specified in the category
"PIZPALUE - CUSTOMER BASE" from the constants editor.

To get an app icon set for all major platforms the resources might be generated
at the `"Favicon generator" <https://realfavicongenerator.net/>`__ website. The
resulting resources need to be copied to the server web directory and the header
data assigned to the related field in the app icon section in the category
"PIZPALUE - CUSTOMER BASE" from the constants editor. Remove any line breaks.


.. _config-fastmenu:

Fastmenu
========

By enabling the fastmenu an icon menu is shown on the right page border.

The menu items can be associated with a page or a content. In case a content is
referenced it will be shown beside the menu.

The following configurations are available:

================================ ===============================================
Category                         Purpose
================================ ===============================================
PIZPALUE:CUSTOMER BASE           To enable and disable the menu
PIZPALUE:CUSTOMER EXTENDED       To define the icon and referenced content/page
PIZPALUE:CUSTOMER STYLE          To define colors
================================ ===============================================

.. note::

   The amount of menu items can be adjusted through TS. To add a new item the
   following code might be used.

   .. code-block:: typoscript

      pizpalue.menu.fast.items {
         newItem {
            iconClass = ppicon ppicon-log-in
            contentUid =
            pageUid =
         }
      }

.. note::

   Embed new icons by generating your own icon font.

.. _config-seo:

SEO
===

#. Review content (focus on user experience)
#. Review seo tags like title-tag and description meta-tag
#. Create a `sitemap <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ApiOverview/XmlSitemap/Index.html>`__

.. hint::

   In the site configuration specify a `robots.txt` as static route containing a
   sitemap. This helps search engines to crawl the site and further registrations
   at search engines might not be needed. An example `robots.txt` might look as
   following:

   .. code-block:: text

      User-agent: *
      Disallow: /typo3/
      Disallow: /typo3_src/
      Allow: /typo3/sysext/frontend/Resources/Public/*

      Sitemap: https://www.domain.ch/sitemap.xml


Google

If needed follow these steps to setup and register the site at google:

#. Register domain as new property at search console
#. Verify ownership by adding google-site-verification code to the related seo
   constant (see figure below)
#. Register sitemap at google search console
#. Register domain in google analytics
#. Add google analytics code to the related seo constant (see figure below)
