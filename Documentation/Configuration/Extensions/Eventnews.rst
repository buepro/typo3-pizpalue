=====================
Extension `eventnews`
=====================

The following description refers to the plugin content element.

Layout
======

Per default the calendar view shows a calendar from the month and a list from
events taking place in the selected month.

In case just the calendar should be shown the field `Template Layout` (register
Template) can be set to `Compact (month)`. To extend the view with a filter
panel the layout `Extended (month)` can be selected.

Titles
======

The default title can be overridden by the `subheader` field in case the `header`
field is empty. It is only rendered if the field Â´header type` is not `hidden`.
The header type is taken into account.

Various
=======

.. tip::
   In case no event is shown review the setting for the field `Event Restriction`
   under the register `Eventnews`.

.. tip::
   To only show upcoming events the field `Time limit (LOW)` can be set to `now`
   in the plugin content element.

.. tip::
   To show events in search results add the following TS to the setup where the
   plugin is located:
   `plugin.tx_news.settings.overrideFlexformSettingsIfEmpty:= removeFromList(eventRestriction)`

.. tip::
   To change the label for the location detail link the following TS can be used:
   `plugin.tx_pizpalue._LOCAL_LANG.default.tx-eventnews-locationDetailLink = Show location`
