The extension builds on Benjamin Kott's
`Bootstrap Package <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/bootstrap_package>`__
and serves as a template for creating complete TYPO3 websites and
:doc:`distributions <t3coreapi:ExtensionArchitecture/CreateNewDistribution/Index>`
that use the Twitter Bootstrap library.

The extension configures TYPO3 and extends it with selected extensions to
provide better structured and appealing content while optimizing speed and SEO
performance.
