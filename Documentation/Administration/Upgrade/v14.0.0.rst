Upgrade to version 14.0
==========================================

Breaking changes
================

Correct background size in tiles (03.10.2022, 61ce0c8)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

An upgrade wizard step has been altered to
move background color defining classes to
the background color field. This might
lead to a less dominant css definition
which in turn could result in background
colors not being overwritten anymore.

Corrective action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Review the content element backgrounds
and correct them in the site package.
Focus on content elements that used
bootstrap classes like `bg-primary`.


Add content element inner class field (23.09.2022, a0beac5)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The new content element field allows to assign css
classes to the inner container enabling more diverse
styling. Remember the inner container is only
available when the content element contains a frame.

As a result css classes acting on the inner content
element container became obsolete and have been
dropped. This includes the following classes:

`pp-inner-margin, pp-inner-padding,
pp-inner-bgwhite70, pp-inner-bggrey70,
pp-inner-bgblack70`.

Corrective actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Carry out the update wizards to rename or move
   dropped css classes.

*  If still needed add the dropped classes to the
   site package.


Enable background color in frameless ce (23.09.2022, 635b755)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The background color selector is now as well
available for frameless content elements. In
this context the classes `pp-space-before-none`
and `pp-space-after-none` have been dropped.

Corrective action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adapt your site package to the absent space
classes `pp-space-before-none` and
`pp-space-after-none`.


Drop frameless content css class (23.09.2022, 2b38309)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The class `pp-content` was initially used in
content elements to indicate that no frame
is used. For clarity reasons a more descriptive
class `pp-frameless-content` has been
introduced some time ago leading to have two
classes serving the same purpose. This
redundancy has now been resolved.

Corrective action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace references to the css class
`pp-content` with `pp-frameless-content`.


Drop language menu css + refactor scss (23.09.2022, 217c899)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The language menu style definitions were dropped.

Corrective action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If needed they should be added to the site
package.


Drop 3rd party extension css (23.09.2022, fb97486)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Small css adjustments from several extensions
have been dropped.

Corrective action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If needed they should be added to the site
package.


Drop scss link and background mixins (23.09.2022, 36b7278)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The scss mixins `pp-make-link` and
`pp-make-background` have been dropped.

Corrective action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If needed the mixins should be added to the site
package.


Drop css card classes (23.09.2022, d9bb148)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The classes `pp-card-[color-key]` have been
dropped.

Corrective action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Use the upgrade wizard to replace the
   card with the respective panel classes
   in the content element attributes
   field.

*  Replace `pp-card-[color-key]` with
   `pp-inner-panel pp-inner-panel-[color-key]`
   else where. Replace `[color-key]` with
   one of the brand colors.


Add scss frame background variables (23.09.2022, a08abdc)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

To simplify frame background adjustments scss
variables `pp-frame-background-[color-key]`
have been added where `[color-key]` has to be
substituted with one of the brand colors
(primary, secondary, etc.).

To adjust a frame with a background color
a typoscript declaration can be added to
the site package as following:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   plugin.bootstrap_package.settings.scss {
      pp-frame-background-primary = ('color': 'red')
   }

With this change the link styling has been
simplified by dropping the extended styling
when `link-color: inherit` has been in place.
In case a site package makes use of it the
link styling will be altered.

Corrective actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Redefine the link styling in the site package.


Drop redundant css color classes (23.09.2022, 914f040)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following classes defining the background color
have been dropped:

`pp-bg-primary, pp-bg-secondary, pp-bg-complementary,
pp-bg-light, pp-bg-dark`

The background can already be defined with the
bootstrap classes.

Corrective actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Run the upgrade wizard to replace the custom
   classes with their bootstrap counterpart.

*  Replace the dropped classes manually by
   removing the "pp-" prefix from the class.


Rename headings color scss variable (23.09.2022, 90f9c92)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The scss variable `--pp-frame-heading-color`
has been renamed to `--pp-frame-headings-color`.

The josh animation attribute name has been changed
from `data-josh-delay` to `data-josh-anim-delay`
in pizpalue version 12. The substitution method

result animations still using the old attribute
