=====================
Extension `eventnews`
=====================

The extension `eventnews` adds additional fields to the `news` extension allowing to define events and provides a view
to show them in a month based calendar. This extension alters the standard calendar view by removing the filter panel
and showing event information within the calendar by means of popup dialogs (`see example
<https://pizpalue.buechler.pro/das-plus/eventnews/>`__).

   Calendar view from events

To use the calendar view provided by this extension the static `Pizpalue - eventnews (pizpalue)` needs to be added
to `Include static (from extensions)` from the template record.
